# MapReduce

---

I PASS all the mr tests in MIT 6.824 2022 project. 
So some names might be strange in 2020 version. For 
example, the master.go should have the Master object. 
But it is Coordinator there as you can see. However,
that does not matter at all because the name does not 
affect the correctness and any necessary changes are made.

To ensure that the implementation is indeed correct. I
made a simple script `ensurance_test.sh` in this directory
to test the implementations. And the result is that all
test iteration shows `*** PASSED ALL TESTS`.

Overall, this lab is simple. Just to feel the distributed
system basic idea.
