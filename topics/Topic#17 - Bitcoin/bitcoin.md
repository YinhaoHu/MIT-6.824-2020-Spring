## Focus

- How does Bitcoin solve the double spending problem?

- How does Bitcoin solve the forgery problem?

- How does Bitcoin solve the fork problem?

- How is the concensus made in the open distributed environment with possible Byzantine participants?

## Basic Idea

- Digital signature: to identify the users and protect the messages in a limited form.

- Serial number: to prevent duplicated messages.

- Public ledger: make every node in the system the 'bank'.

- Proof-of-work: solve the double spend problem. Even if one user allocates many CPUs, it impractical for him to make double spend happen. Besides, the PoW is based on one-CPU-one-vote instead of one-IP-address-one-vote, this can introduce so much cost for one attacker to subvert the chain.
